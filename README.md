This goal of this project is to allow users to create an account and a stock watchlist. The watchlist will check for any news articles with a given ticker, and return a positive or negative sentment analysis on them.

Sentiment-Aggregator is the java portion that handles the authentication, watchlist, and main program
Sentiment-Analyzer is the Python portion that handles the sentiment analysis in a Flask microservice
